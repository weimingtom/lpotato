    <h1>Examples version 3.0 Release Notes</h1>
    <p>
      From time to time, I update the examples based on reader feedback
      about bugs. It's my intention to <i>only</i> update the examples
      when they do not follow the specifications, as opposed to add
      work-arounds for specification-compliance bugs in various
      containers. In the latter case, I instead inform the vendor about
      the problem, in the hope that these examples will have a positive
      impact on container-compliance over time.
    </p>
    <h2>Notes about the initial 2.0 version</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This inital version of the examples includes the Apache Taglibs
        Standard tag library, version 1.1.0-B1, which is the reference
        implementation of the JSTL 1.1 specification. To download a more
        recent version, if any, go to the 
        <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/taglibs/">Apache Taglibs web 
         site.</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        All examples have been tested with Tomcat 5.0.16, using JDK 1.4.2.
